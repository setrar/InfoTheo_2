    "## Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Coded Caching** is a communication technique that leverages caching and coding to improve the efficiency of data delivery in networks with multiple users. It is particularly useful in systems where users request data from a shared source, such as video streaming platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Concepts**\n",
    "1. **Caching**:\n",
    "   - A portion of data is pre-stored (cached) at user devices or intermediate nodes during periods of low network usage (e.g., overnight).\n",
    "   - The cached content reduces the need to repeatedly transmit the same data to multiple users.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Coding**:\n",
    "   - During data delivery, instead of sending individual data files to each user, the server sends **coded combinations** of files.\n",
    "   - Users decode their requested data by using the received coded data and their cached content.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Goal**:\n",
    "   - Minimize the communication load (amount of transmitted data) during peak usage times.\n",
    "   - Exploit **multicasting opportunities** by serving multiple users simultaneously with coded transmissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How Coded Caching Works**\n",
    "1. **Placement Phase** (Caching):\n",
    "   - Happens during off-peak times.\n",
    "   - The server partitions data into segments and caches specific segments at the user devices according to a predefined caching policy.\n",
    "   - This phase is independent of the users' future requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Delivery Phase**:\n",
    "   - Happens during peak times when users request specific files.\n",
    "   - The server sends coded data that simultaneously satisfies the requests of multiple users.\n",
    "   - Users reconstruct their requested files using the coded transmissions and their cached content.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Mathematical Framework**\n",
    "- **Setup**:\n",
    "  - $K$: Number of users.\n",
    "  - $N$: Number of files in the library.\n",
    "  - $M$: Cache size at each user (in file units).\n",
    "  - $R$: Delivery rate (amount of transmitted data normalized by file size).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Trade-off**:\n",
    "  - The coded caching scheme achieves a trade-off between cache size $M$ and delivery rate $R$.\n",
    "  - Example (fundamental bound):\n",
    "$R(M) \\leq K \\left( 1 - \\frac{M}{N} \\right)$\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Advantages**\n",
    "1. **Efficient Multicasting**:\n",
    "   - Simultaneously serves multiple users, reducing network congestion.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Scalability**:\n",
    "   - As the number of users increases, coded caching significantly reduces the required transmission load compared to traditional caching.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Applicability**:\n",
    "   - Effective in scenarios like content delivery networks (CDNs), video-on-demand, and edge computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example**\n",
    "Suppose there are $K = 3$ users and $N = 3$ files $\\{A, B, C\\}$, and each user has cached $1/2$ of each file. During delivery:\n",
    "- User 1 requests $A$, User 2 requests $B$, and User 3 requests $C$.\n",
    "- The server sends coded combinations like $A \\oplus B$, $B \\oplus C$, and $C \\oplus A$.\n",
    "- Each user decodes their requested file using the coded data and their cached segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Applications**\n",
    "1. **Content Delivery Networks**:\n",
    "   - Reduces latency and bandwidth usage in streaming services.\n",
    "2. **Wireless Networks**:\n",
    "   - Improves spectral efficiency by leveraging coded multicasting.\n",
    "3. **Edge Computing**:\n",
    "   - Enhances data delivery efficiency in edge-cache-enabled systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Insight**\n",
    "Coded caching leverages **both local storage (cache)** and **global communication (coded transmission)** to minimize the delivery load, making it a powerful tool for optimizing data delivery in modern networks."
